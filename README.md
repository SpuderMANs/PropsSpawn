# PropsSpawn
**PropsSpawn** is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory using EXILED . Introduces a simple way to spawn props (predefined SCP:SL prefabs). You can manage these props however you like, moving them, rotating them, and more! It is designed to make map customization fast, intuitive, and fully in-game, without needing external map editors.

## Features

### In-game prop spawning

Spawn any networked prefab directly in-game using partial name matching.
No need to know the full prefab name — PropSpawn will find it for you.

---

### Prop manipulation

Interact with spawned props using simple actions:

* **Move props** by attaching them to your view and placing them elsewhere
* **Rotate props** incrementally on each axis
* **Delete props** directly by looking at them

All interactions are performed in real time and synced to all players.
---

### Map saving system

Save all spawned props to a JSON file:

* Each prop is linked to its **room**
* Position is stored as a **room-local offset**
* Rotation is fully preserved

This makes saved maps resilient to world position changes.
